# QuietAI Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** December 16, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how QuietAI (the "Extension") collects, uses, and safeguards information when you use the Microsoft Edge extension available at the Edge Add-ons Store.

QuietAI is designed to modify or enhance prompts you send to AI chat interfaces (e.g., ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Claude). QuietAI does **not** operate a server and does **not** collect, store, or sell personal data.

---

## 1. Information We Do (and Do Not) Collect

### 1.1 No Account, No Signup
We do not require you to create an account or sign in.

### 1.2 No Personal Data Collection
The Extension does not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, payment information, or other personally identifiable information (PII).

### 1.3 Local Settings Only
Configuration settings (e.g., enabled modes like Concise, TL;DR, Bullet Points, Code Only) are stored **locally** in your browser using `chrome.storage` / `browser.storage` APIs. These settings remain on your device unless you clear them via your browser settings or uninstall the Extension.

### 1.4 Technical Data
- **No telemetry by default.** QuietAI does not send analytics or usage data to any external server.
- **Runtime context.** When active on supported sites (e.g., chatgpt.com, copilot.microsoft.com, gemini.google.com, claude.ai), QuietAI reads page content necessary to apply your selected modes and inject instruction text into your prompts. This processing happens entirely **client-side** in your browser.

### 1.5 Permissions
QuietAI requests only the permissions needed to operate on supported domains (e.g., `activeTab`, `scripting`, `storage`). It does **not** request broad host permissions beyond supported AI chat interfaces.

---

## 2. How We Use Information
- Apply your configured modes to prompts before they are submitted to the AI interface.
- Persist your preferences locally so the Extension behaves consistently across sessions.
- We do **not** use your information for advertising, profiling, or resale.

---

## 3. Data Sharing and Transfers
We do not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties.

---

## 4. Children's Privacy
QuietAI is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

---

## 5. Security
Because QuietAI stores settings locally and does not transmit data to remote servers, risks are limited to your device and browser environment. We recommend keeping your browser and operating system up to date and using reputable security practices.

---

## 6. Your Choices
- **Enable/Disable Modes:** Use the Extension popup to toggle modes on or off.
- **Clear Data:** Remove local settings via your browser's extension storage controls or by uninstalling the Extension.

---

## 7. Third-Party Services
QuietAI interacts with third-party AI chat websites that you visit. Your prompts and any data you submit to those services are governed by **their** respective privacy policies and terms. Please review the policies of ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Claude, or any other site you use with QuietAI.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect improvements or regulatory requirements. Material changes will update the **Last updated** date above. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

By installing and using QuietAI, you acknowledge this Privacy Policy and consent to local storage of configuration settings required for the Extension.
